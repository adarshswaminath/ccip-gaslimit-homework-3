# CCIP Gas Limit Optimization

This repository contains a test suite for measuring and optimizing the gas consumption of the `ccipReceive` function in the Chainlink CCIP protocol. Following the tutorial, we have measured the gas usage and increased the gas limit by 10%, applying this new limit to the `transferUsdc` function.
